Our Disco Boards&trade; are a family of FPGA development boards designed to prototype industrial hardware. They're the same boards we use internally to design our products. 

The goal of these Disco Boards is to grant early access to our solutions. We hope this will encourage collaboration and make our development process more transparent.
