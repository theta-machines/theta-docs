The [Disco Board &ndash; ETH4K](https://www.thetamachines.com/shop/eth4k/) is a completely open-source FPGA development board based on the iCE40HX4K. The board includes several robust communication methods such as Ethernet, USB, and abundant GPIO.

The iCE40HX4K features 3,520 logic cells, 80k-bits of embedded RAM, and 2 PLLs. The official tools for working with this device are [iCEcube2 Design Software](https://www.latticesemi.com/iCEcube2) and [Diamond Programmer](https://www.latticesemi.com/programmer). iCEcube2 is used to generate the bitmaps, and Diamond Programmer is used to flash the bitmaps onto the FPGA.

## Key Features
* 90 fully programmable GPIO
* 4 analog inputs (12-bit resolution)
* 10BASE-T/100BASE-TX Ethernet controller
* USB-UART bridge
* 1MiB of flash memory
* Storage of up to four separate bitstreams
